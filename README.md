# CS6024CancerSubtypesClustering
This repository contains the course project for the course CS6024, where we developed a unique approach to clustering of cancer subtypes, which showed promising results when compared to benchmarks.

## Method 1

You can find the following *.py files, containing classes where several essential functions have been implemented that we were able to reuse in the analysis notebooks.
1. classifiers.py (used primarily in the supervised feature extraction code)
2. miRNAProcessor.py (used in loading and processing miRNA data before analysis)
3. subnetwork_generator.py (used for generation of subnetworks)

Furthermore, the notebooks have been numbered 1 through 9, depicting the order in which they must be run.

The *.txt files were generated while running the notebooks, and contain useful intermediate information such as the clustering dictionary containing the subnetworks obtained, and the cluster labels assigned to each data point.

## Method 2

The various steps of the analysis pipeline of method 2 have been summarised in the given notebook.
